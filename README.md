# MT10_cryptography
This reposery is part of a course called "STRUCTURE,FORMAL CALCULUS AND ALGORITHMS". This course aims to explain the different algebra stuctures (finite field, elliptic curve, ...) and apply them with cryptographic algorithms (RSA, error detection and correction with GRS codes).

This reposery contains the 3 practical works of this course.
